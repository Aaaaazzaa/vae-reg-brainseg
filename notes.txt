- Train without normalization
  # Started training at 11:30am
    - This resulted in NaNs which reminded me that this was an issue before.
    - How to confirm whether or not the data is normalized?
- Reconstruction loss on decoder

- How and what data to save for visualization of training
  - Use Tensorboard
  - Save configs with model and what not and stats?
    - Prob not is using TB

- How to get a brain mask for normalization?
- Preprocess offline normalization?
- What's up with inference?
- Can we submit for scoring to MICCAI?
- Multiple jobs for parameter sweeps
- Save configs with model and what not and stats
- Command line usage stuff
- Dense connections
